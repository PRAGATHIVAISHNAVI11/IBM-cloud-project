🏭 Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

🚀 Problem Statement (IBM SkillsBuild/AICTE Challenge)
Develop a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of industrial machines to anticipate failures before they occur. The model will analyze sensor data to identify patterns that precede specific types of failures such as:

Tool Wear

Power Failure

Overstrain

📈 Project Objective
To build and deploy a machine learning classification model that predicts the type of failure based on real-time operational data from industrial machines.
